# Î” Differ
A simple and performant command-line diff tool that opens the result in the browser.


### Use
Run using `differ.exe file1.txt file2.txt [options]` with the files you want to diff and eventually options.  

Available options:
  * `unifiedview`/`splitview`: how to display the result (single panel/double panel side-by-side).
  * `collapselines`/`expandelines`: show all lines in the file or only those with differences and their context.
  * `contextsize <int>`: how many lines of context to display for the collapselines option. 3 by default.

  * `ignorewhitespace`: ignore whitespace differences. Off by default.
  * `ignorecase`: ignore case differences. Off by default.
  * `lcs`/`patience`: the method to use to compare. "patience" by default.

You can configure external tools to use differ. For example, in SourceTree under `Tools > Options > Diff`, you can set  
	External Diff Tool: Custom  
	Diff Command = "path/to/Differ.exe"  
	Arguments="\"$LOCAL\" \"$REMOTE\" splitview patience collapselines"  

### Config
You can modify the look of the output by modifying template_split.html or template_unified.html


<div style="width: 10px; height: 10px; background: #ffcbbd;"></div>

### TODO
  - improve diff LCS and empty lines
  - fix html scrolling background missing
  - provide option to tradeoff between number of edits vs total lengh of edits
